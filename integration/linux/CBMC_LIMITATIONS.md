# CBMC limitations encountered during Linux kernel analysis

A running log of points where CBMC's current capability constrains
the analysis work in `integration/linux/`.  Each entry records:

- a concise statement of the limitation;
- the specific symptom we saw;
- how we worked around it (if we could), and what we deferred (if we
  couldn't);
- any upstream issue/PR reference, once filed.

The file is append-only from this point forward; mark resolved items
inline rather than removing them.

## LIM-001 — `library_check.sh` fails mid-build — **RESOLVED**

**First hit:** M3 rebuild, CBMC commit range `6b6c8d326d..166a7d4af3`.

Building any target that depended on `libansi-c.a` produced

```
[N/M] Generating library-check.stamp
FAILED: src/ansi-c/library-check.stamp ...
Tests and library functions don't match.
```

with a list of `*-01` test directory names under
`regression/cbmc-library/` flagged as "tests not matching any library
function."

**Root cause.** The working tree contained 163 orphaned directories
under `regression/cbmc-library/` that had `msvc.out` / `test.out`
artifacts but no `test.desc` — remnants from a prior test run that
had not been cleaned up.  The `library_check.sh` script lists the
on-disk directory contents and diffs them against the set of
functions defined in `src/*/library/*.c`; the orphaned output
directories showed up as phantom tests.

**Fix.** Remove and re-check-out the directory:

```sh
rm -rf regression/cbmc-library
git checkout HEAD -- regression/cbmc-library
rm -f build/src/ansi-c/library-check.stamp
cmake --build build --target cbmc
```

After this, `make` succeeds without any workaround.  The upstream
`library_check.sh` itself is working correctly; the problem was
local filesystem pollution.

## LIM-002 — `goto-instrument --enforce-contract` on a function with a loop requires loop contracts — **RESOLVED via `--dfcc`**

**First hit:** M2, `page_provenance/set_page_prov`.

Running

```
goto-instrument --enforce-contract set_page_prov <in.gb> <out.gb>
```

on a function whose body contained a `for` loop produced

```
File: src/goto-instrument/contracts/contracts.cpp:1152
Condition: is_loop_free(function_body, ns, log)
Reason: Loops remain in function 'set_page_prov', assigns clause
        checking instrumentation cannot be applied.
```

and aborted with a core dump.

**Fix.** Switch to the dynamic frame-condition checking path by
prefixing the invocation with `--dfcc <harness>`:

```
goto-instrument --dfcc main --enforce-contract set_page_prov <in.gb> <out.gb>
```

DFCC accepts loop-bodied functions without pre-existing loop
invariants, and the subsequent `cbmc` run verifies the contract
with bounded unwinding of the loops (we use `--unwind 8
--unwinding-assertions` on a `PAGE_PROV_TABLE_SIZE`-2 or -3 compile).

DFCC has a different constraint instead: *only one top-level call to
the function under check per harness*.  Harnesses that want to
enforce multiple contracts either have one `main()` per target
(selected by `-DENFORCE_<name>`; see
`properties/aead/test_enforce.c` and
`properties/scatterlist/test_enforce.c`) or run `goto-instrument`
once per target.  This is minor in practice.

Status: all three property modules
(`page_provenance`, `scatterlist`, `aead`) now have working
`goto-instrument --dfcc --enforce-contract` regressions for every
one of their public functions.

## LIM-003 — `goto-instrument` aborts rather than failing gracefully — **PARTIALLY MITIGATED**

**First hit:** concurrent with LIM-002.

When `goto-instrument --enforce-contract` (the non-DFCC path)
detected a situation it could not handle, it aborted (SIGABRT with
a core dump) and wrote a `Backtrace:` dump to stderr.  Moving to
`--dfcc` removed that particular failure mode for our use cases, but
the general ergonomic issue remains: a user-visible error with a
non-zero exit code would be easier for scripting and CI than a
SIGABRT, and core dumps are not a constructive signal for an
internal invariant violation.

**Workaround.** Scripts defend against the output file not being
produced; we kept that defensive pattern in all `run.sh` scripts
even after switching to DFCC.

**Status.** Cosmetic once DFCC is the default path for us; candidate
for a small CBMC contribution to convert the invariant-violation
into a diagnostic exit.

## LIM-004 — Inlined `static inline` kernel functions are not directly replaceable by a contract

**First hit:** M3 stretch, `crypto/algif_aead.c` from Linux 5.10.

Unchanged from the original entry.  Two-step workaround
(`--remove-function-body` on the kernel binary, then relink with the
property module) remains the plan for M4.  DFCC does not affect
this limitation — it concerns symbol linkage, not contract
enforcement.

## LIM-005 — Preprocessing depends on the host glibc laying out a header that recent glibc removed

**First hit:** M3 stretch, preparing Linux 5.10 for
`make crypto/algif_aead.o`.

Unchanged.  Environmental; not a CBMC issue.

## LIM-006 — Whole-function CBMC on a real kernel source file does not terminate without stubbing

**First hit:** M3 stretch, running `cbmc --function _aead_recvmsg` on
the compiled `crypto/algif_aead.c`.

Unchanged.  Resolved by the M4 pipeline design (aggressive
abstraction via `--replace-call-with-contract` for every annotated
primitive, `--drop-unused-functions`, `--remove-function-body` for
kernel helpers whose behaviour is irrelevant to the property being
checked).
