There is a need for further debugging around copying local objects in
the procedure spawning threads as we generate the following non-sensical
constraint:
// 28 file regression/cbmc-concurrency/dirty_local3/main.c line 3 function worker
(57) CONSTRAINT(z!1@0#2 == z!1@0 || !choice_rf0)
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                comparison of L2 and L1 SSA symbols
// 28 file regression/cbmc-concurrency/dirty_local3/main.c line 3 function worker
(58) CONSTRAINT(choice_rf0)
