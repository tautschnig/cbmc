Transitive Calls Regression Tests
=================================

These tests exercise the transitive calls code in
goto-programs/transitive_calls.{h,cpp}.

To run the tests:
- Make sure you have a copy of Ruby installed
- Change the CPROVER_ROOT variable in the Makefile to point to your
  cprover directory
- Run `make`.

All tests should pass. If you make changes to the code, please re-run
the tests; if you find a bug in the code, please add a regression test
that fails due to the bug.
